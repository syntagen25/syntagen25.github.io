The field of computer vision has undergone a significant transformation in recent
years with the advancement of generative models, particularly text-to-image models
such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and DALLE-3. These models have enabled the
creation of synthetic visual datasets that are highly realistic and diverse, complete
with annotations and rich variations. These datasets have proven to be extremely
valuable in training and evaluating various computer vision algorithms, including
object detection and segmentation, representation learning, and scene understanding. The SyntaGen workshop will act as a crucible for an inclusive exchange of
ideas, practical insights, and collaborative explorations. By convening experts and
enthusiasts from various corners of the field, it strives to propel the development of
generative models and synthetic visual datasets to new heights. Through informative talks, challenges, poster sessions, paper presentations, and vibrant panel discussions, this workshop endeavors to lay the foundation for innovative breakthroughs that bridge the realms of generative models and computer vision applications.

  <img src="./assets/img2/dataset-diff-teaser.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>


#### Dataset and metric
The primary objective of this competition is to drive innovation in the creation of high-quality synthetic datasets, leveraging only the pretrained [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion) and the 20 class names from [PASCAL VOC 2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/) for semantic segmentation. The evaluation of synthetic dataset quality involves training a [DeepLabv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587) model on the synthetic dataset and subsequently assessing its performance on a private test set on the task of semantic segmentation  (a sample validation set is the validation set of [PASCAL VOC 2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/)). Submissions are ranked based on the **mIoU** metric. This competition framework mirrors the practical application of synthetic datasets, particularly in scenarios where they replace real datasets.

#### Requirements
Teams are required to upload their synthetic datasets to **Google Drive** for public access. The dataset should include a maximum of **10K** pairs of synthesized images and semantic segmentations, each image being **512x512** in size. We will supply a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kizZ0Ix2SNP11qy_VMhr0NLGlI5-oMNT) codebase for exemplifying some random training images and their annotations, DeepLabv3 training and evaluation, using a **Resnet-50** backbone, and showing qualitative results. Training and evaluation time for DeepLabv3 is capped at **10K iterations** with a **batch size of 8**.  The codebase should remain unchanged except for the Google Drive file ID provided by each team. For text prompts, participants can leverage various methods, including LLMs like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). For text-to-image generation, participants can choose either **Stable Diffusion (v1.x) or (v2.x)**. However, participants cannot use any additional segmentation datasets. One approach can be [Dataset Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14303), and the source code for which is accessible at [Github](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/Dataset-Diffusion/tree/main).

#### Submission and evaluation
The submission comprises two phases with two separate deadlines,
outlined as follows:

1.  **Random seed + DeepLabv3 + Dataset**. By the first deadline in this phase, each
team must use their method to generate their synthetic dataset and train a DeepLabv3 on
it. Each team must submit:
* The **random seed** used in their model for dataset generation, 
* The **generated dataset** 
* The **checksum of the trained DeepLabv3**. The checksum
code will be provided as part of the Colab codebase. Modifications to the model, the trained
DeepLabv3, or the generated dataset are prohibited after this deadline.

2.  **Code + Score**. After the first deadline, our private test set will be released to each team.
Each team must evaluate their trained DeepLabv3 on the test set and submit their code and
mIoU score on the same Colab file as in the previous deadline by the final deadline.

Entries will be evaluated based on their mIoU, and the top submissions will be contacted for further
verification. These selected participants will be required to share their code (via **GitHub**) to replicate
the synthetic datasets (consisting of images and annotations) using the specified random seed and
checksum. Additionally, the provided Google Colab file will be employed to reproduce both the
training and inference processes of DeepLabv3, ensuring accurate results and confirming adherence
to Stable Diffusion as the exclusive text-to-image generator. Any submissions found to
be non-compliant or in violation of the rules will be disqualified. In such instances, the evaluation
process will continue with the subsequent submissions until the final top 2 are determined

#### Submission Form:
[Google Form submission link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrfhYbRtYUEbcizuMBagcHBbFf6cemjdTh8OnF7E7nCrFA0Q/viewform)

#### Google Colab file training and evaluating synthetic dataset
Please use this [Google Colab file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kizZ0Ix2SNP11qy_VMhr0NLGlI5-oMNT) for training and evaluating your synthetic dataset. 
<br>
**Note:** You can run it in Google Colab or download it as a Jupyter notebook to run on your local machine (advised).


#### Prizes and presentation: 
We will award the top 2 teams with cash prizes **(Rank 1: $1000, Rank 2: $500)** and invite them to write a report and present their work at the workshop **(10 minutes each)**.

<!-- ### Ethical considerations for the datasets
Since the evaluated dataset is the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2012, it shares the same ethical considerations with PASCAL VOC 2012. Besides, the generated
synthetic training set has new considers including

 * **Data Bias and Fairness**: The creation of synthetic datasets through Stable Diffusion
can introduce unintended biases, potentially deviating from real-world data characteristics.
Ethical vigilance is essential to identify and rectify any biases, ensuring that the synthetic
datasets remain representative, unbiased, and fair.

* **Privacy and Consent**: Although synthetic datasets do not involve real individuals’ data,
traces of underlying characteristics might inadvertently capture sensitive information. Up-holding ethical principles necessitates the thorough anonymization or removal of such data
traces to protect privacy and respect consent standards. -->
